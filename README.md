## About this project

This is the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) adaptation of [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/) [Adminator Admin Dashboard Template](https://github.com/puikinsh/Adminator-admin-dashboard).

The objective of this project is to facilitate this template to Laravel developers, since the implementation of the official project to a blade template is not trivial
