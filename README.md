## About this project

This is the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) adaptation of [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/) [Adminator Admin Dashboard Template](https://github.com/puikinsh/Adminator-admin-dashboard).

The objective of this project is to facilitate this template to Laravel developers, since the implementation of the official project to a blade template is not trivial

## Prerequisites
You just need to clone the repository and meet the [Laravel 6.x requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x#server-requirements).
